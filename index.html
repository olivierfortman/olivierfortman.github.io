          Motivated by questions arising in the theory of moduli spaces in real algebraic geometry, 
          we develop a range of methods to study the topology of the real locus of a Deligne-Mumford stack over the real numbers. 
          As an application, we verify in several cases the Smith-Thom type inequality for stacks that we conjectured in an earlier work. 
          This requires combining techniques from group theory, algebraic geometry, and topology.

        <div class="abstract">
          To a topological groupoid endowed with an involution, we associate a topological groupoid of fixed points, generalizing the fixed-point subspace of a topological space with involution. 
We prove that when the topological groupoid with involution arises from a Deligne-Mumford stack over the real numbers, this fixed locus coincides with the real locus of the stack. 
This provides a topological framework to study real algebraic stacks, and in particular real moduli spaces. 
Finally, we propose a Smith-Thom type conjecture in this setting, generalizing the Smith-Thom inequality for topological spaces endowed with an involution.

          We develop a new method of constructing non-arithmetic lattices

	on a complex arithmetic ball quotient, glue their fixed loci along geodesic subspaces,

  For a curve of genus at least four which is either very general or very general hyperelliptic,

	As an application, we show that, for a very general principally polarized abelian variety of dimension at least four,

	This confirms some cases of the Coleman-Oort conjecture. We further deduce from our results some progress on the question

 We show that each connected component of the moduli space of smooth real binary quintics is isomorphic to an arithmetic quotient 
	of an open subset of the real hyperbolic plane. Moreover, our main result says that the induced metric 
	on this moduli space extends to a complete real hyperbolic orbifold structure on the space of stable 
	real binary quintics. This turns the moduli space of stable real binary quintics into a real 
	two-dimensional ball quotient, whose fundamental domain is given by the hyperbolic triangle 
	of angles π/3,π/5 and π/10, and whose fundamental group is non-arithmetic.

We prove the real integral Hodge conjecture for several classes

	for real abelian threefolds A whose real locus A(ℝ) is connected, 
	and for real abelian threefolds A which are a product A=B×E of an 
	abelian surface B and an elliptic curve E with connected real locus E(ℝ).

	real integral Hodge conjecture modulo torsion, and reduce the general

We prove the integral Hodge conjecture for one-cycles 
	on a principally polarized complex abelian variety whose 
	minimal class is algebraic. In particular, the Jacobian of a 
	smooth projective curve over the complex numbers satisfies the 
	integral Hodge conjecture for one-cycles. The main ingredient is a 
	lift of the Fourier transform to integral Chow groups. Similarly, 
	we prove the integral Tate conjecture for one-cycles on the Jacobian of a 
	smooth projective curve over the separable closure of a finitely generated field. 
	Furthermore, abelian varieties satisfying such a conjecture are dense in their moduli space.

For fixed k < g and a family of polarized abelian varieties of dimension g over ℝ⁠, we give a criterion for the 
  density in the parameter space of those abelian varieties over ℝ containing a k-dimensional abelian subvariety over ℝ⁠. 
  As application, we prove density of such a set in the moduli space of polarized real abelian varieties of dimension g and density of real algebraic curves mapping
  non-trivially to real k-dimensional abelian varieties in the moduli space of real algebraic curves as well as in the space of real plane curves.
  This extends to the real setting results by Colombo and Pirola. 
  We then consider the real locus of an algebraic stack over ℝ⁠, attaching a topological space to it.
  For a real moduli stack, this defines a real moduli space. We show that for Mg and Ag⁠, the real moduli spaces that arise in this way coincide with the moduli spaces 
  of Gross–Harris and Seppälä–Silhol.

          This thesis intends to make a contribution to the theories of algebraic cycles and moduli spaces over the real numbers. 
	In the study of the subvarieties of a projective algebraic variety, smooth over the field of real numbers, the cycle class map between 
	the Chow ring and the equivariant cohomology ring plays an important role. The image of the cycle class map remains difficult to describe 
	in general; we study this group in detail in the case of real abelian varieties. To do so, we construct integral Fourier transforms on Chow rings
	of abelian varieties over any field. They allow us to prove the integral Hodge conjecture for one-cycles on complex Jacobian varieties, and the 
	real integral Hodge conjecture modulo torsion for real abelian threefolds. 
For the theory of real algebraic cycles, and for several other purposes in real algebraic geometry, it is useful to have moduli spaces of real varieties
	to our disposal. Insight in the topology of a real moduli space provides insight in the geometry of a real variety that defines a point in it, 
	and the other way around. In the moduli space of real abelian varieties, as well as in the Torelli locus contained in it, we prove density of 
	the set of moduli points attached to abelian varieties containing an abelian subvariety of fixed dimension. Moreover, we provide the moduli space
	of stable real binary quintics with a hyperbolic orbifold structure, compatible with the period map on the locus of smooth quintics. This identifies
	the moduli space of stable real binary quintics with a non-arithmetic ball quotient.
